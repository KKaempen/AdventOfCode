# AdventOfCode
Repository containing all of my solutions to problems from the Advent of Code coding challenge.

# How to run
Unless otherwise specified, all problems are run with `cat Resources/problem(n).txt | python3 problem(n)(a/b).py`
Some of the problems are run slightly differently, so I will say here how to run them.

## Problem 5
`python3 problem5a.py` then input the filepath to the problem 5 resources (Resources/problem5.txt), and then input 1.

`python3 problem5b.py` then similarly input the filepath, and input 5.
