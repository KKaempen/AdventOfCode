# AdventOfCode
Repository containing all of my solutions to problems from the Advent of Code coding challenge.

# How to run
Each of the problems is run slightly differently, so I will say here how to run them.

## Problem 1
`cat Resources/problem1.txt | python3 problem1(a/b).py`

## Problem 2
`cat Resources/problem2.txt | python3 problem2(a/b).py`

## Problem 3
`cat Resources/problem3.txt | python3 problem3(a/b).py`

## Problem 4
`cat Resources/problem4.txt | python3 problem4(a/b).py`

## Problem 5
`python3 problem5a.py` then input the filepath to the problem 5 resources (Resources/problem5.txt), and then input 1.

`python3 problem5b.py` then similarly input the filepath, and input 5.

## Problem 6
`cat Resources/problem6.txt | python3 problem6(a/b).py`
